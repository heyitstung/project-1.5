EXTRACT - 
I extracted my data by simply coping and pasting team stats into a CVS file.

TRANSFORM - 
I transformed my data by removing columns. I also renamed certain columns.

LOAD -
I created a Table that mirrored my pandas table. I chose to import data to SQL because it is easier to manipulate data. I can modify data any time by adding new queries.
